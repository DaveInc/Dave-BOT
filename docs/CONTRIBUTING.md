# Contributing  
Create a fork of the master branch for your own personal development. If you think you've made a significant contribution to the main code, open a pull request.  
If the code in your pull request is **too** incompatible with the master branch - IE, you've modified the core too much from the original - then we'll close it and ask you to open an issue with details that we can then work around.  
If you want to add a (singular) command, open an issue with the title beginning in !command. If you want to add a group of commands, use !group.  
If you find a bug, check if there's not already an issue open for it, then open one with !bug, giving as much useful detail as possible - we'll want a traceback, but not what you had for lunch.  
Incentive to contribute: we'll add you to the contributors on the repo! Meaning you can contribute more!  
## Syntax  
We use soft tabs (4 spaces), and try to stick close to PEP8.
