Chalmers: Seeeeeeymoooour!

Skinner: Superintendent, I was just- uh, just stretching my calves on the windowsill,
         Isometric exercise!
         Care to join me? 

Chalmers: Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour? 

Skinner: Uh-um, Oh!
         That isn't smoke,
         It's steam,
         Steam from the steamed clams we're having.
         Mmmmmmmm.
         Steamed clams.

(Superintendent leaves)

Skinner: Whew.

(Skinner goes to Krusty Burger)

Skinner: Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouthwatering hamburgers!

Chalmers: I thought we were having steamed clams.

Skinner: D'oh, no.
         I said steamed hams!
         That's what I call hamburgers.

Chalmers: You call hamburgers steamed hams? 

Skinner: Yes,
         It's a regional dialect.

Chalmers: - Uh-huh.
          Uh, what region?

Skinner: Uhhhhhhh-upstate New York(?)

Chalmers: Really.
          Well, I'm from Utica, and I've never heard anyone use the phrase "steamed hams."

Skinner: Oh, not in Utica,
         No,
         It's an Albany expression.

Chalmers: I see.

          You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.

Skinner: (Laughing)
         Ho-ho-ho-Oh no,
         Patented Skinner burgers.
         Old family recipe.

Chalmers: For steamed hams.

Skinner: Yes.

Chalmers: Yes.
          And you call them steamed hams despite the fact that they are obviously grilled?

Skinner: Ye- You know, the- One thing I should- - Excuse me for one second.

Chalmers: Of course.

Skinner: (Yawns loudly) Eauhhhhhhhhh
         Well, that was wonderful.
         good time was had by all.
         I'm pooped.

Chalmers: Yes.
          I should be- Good Lord! What is happening in there?

Skinner: Aurora borealis.

Chalmers: Uh- Aurora borealis, at this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen?

Skinner: Yes!

Chalmers: May I see it?

Skinner: No.

Mother Skinner: Seymour!
                The house is on fire!

Skinner: No, Mother,
         It's just the northern lights.

Chalmers: Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say, you steam a good ham.

Mother Skinner: Help! Help!
